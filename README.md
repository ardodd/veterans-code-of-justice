# veterans-code-of-justice
Veterans Code of Justice is about providing Our Countries Veterans a Resource that is able to find all the Codes used by the VA. 
I am hoping to be able to get help in building a searchable database that will be the back bone of research. 
I am looking for ways to pull the Codes from the Veterans Administration and  Veterans Legal Guides. 
In the process the database would have to include medical definitions, medical guidelines, medical decisions. 
I know and understand that this is not your typical request for help.

I do not know where to begin as i am not a programmer nor do I do code. 
The one thing I am looking at doing is trying to put all the information together in one spot and allowing the user to enter 
their details.
My Goal is to make it where the person entering their information can do so in a secure fashion and the site will not store their 
personal info.

I do not have clue how to extract the information from other websites and store it in a document that would server as the database.
I have a website that I want to start with by extracting the information from the links they provided. 
All this will be time consuming and takes up alot of space.

Here is the website: http://bluewaternavy.org/vsotoolboxlinks2.htm

The Board of Veterans Appeals is another resource i would like to be able to include this database for research reasons.
Here is the Link for it: http://www.index.va.gov/search/va/bva.jsp

I am able to do simple functions if anyone knows how to setup a way for me to enter the type or name of the fields I want to add.

And if you know how to setup a content extractor that would run when I need information to include in the database I sure could one.

I don't have the money to go out and hire a company to do this kind of work. I am a Disabled US Marine Corps Veteran that wants to see
justice for all other veterans and their families. So if you a little bit of extra time and can afford to help us put this together 
and make it functional our debt to you would be honored by the lifes we have lost and those that have all for this great country.

Thank you,
Albert Dodd
